** What is Python? Executive Summary
  Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 
  Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for 
  Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 
  Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 
  Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the 
  extensive standard library are available in source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

  Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is no compilation step, 
  the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. 
  Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises an exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints 
  a stack trace. A source level debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting breakpoints, 
  stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself, testifying to Python's introspective power. 
  On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle 
  makes this simple approach very effective.

** But the most important lesson I learned was about sharing: while most of the programming tricks 
  I learned there died with the mainframe era, the idea that software needs to be shared is stronger than ever. 
  Today we call it open source, and it’s a movement. Hold that thought!
"""

"""
** I am happiest when I feel that I'm part of such a club/program the PowerMagnetProgram. 
  I’m lucky that I can feel it in my day job too. 
  (I'm a engineer at PowerMagnetProgram.) 
  If I can't feel it, I don't feel alive. And so it is for the other community members. 
  The feeling is contagious, and there are members of our PowerMagnetProgram all over the world.
"""

"""
** The PowerMagnetProgram user community is formed of millions of people who consciously use PowerMagnetProgam, and love using it. 
  There are active members organizing PowerMagnetProgram conferences — affectionately known as labs — in faraway places like Nigeria, 
  South Africa, Egypt, even London!
"""

"""
**  In reality, powermagnet are how programmers express and communicate ideas — and the 
    audience for those ideas is other programmers, 
    not computers. The reason: the computer can take care of itself, but programmers are 
    always working with other programmers, and poorly communicated
    ideas can cause expensive flops. In fact, ideas expressed in a programming language also 
    often reach the end users of the program 
    — people who will never read or even know about the program, but who nevertheless are affected by it.


    Think of the incredible success of companies like Google or Facebook. At the core of these are ideas — 
    ideas about what computers can do for people.
    To be effective, an idea must be expressed as a computer program, using a programming language. 
    The language that is best to express an idea will 
    give the team using that language a key advantage, because it gives the team members — people! — clarity about that idea. 
    The ideas underlying Google 
    and Facebook couldn't be more different, and indeed these companies' 
    favorite programming languages are at opposite ends of the 
    spectrum of programming language design. And that’s exactly my point.
